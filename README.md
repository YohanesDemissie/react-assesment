#LOGIC
1. set initial state of input to ''.
2. set initial suggestions state to ''.
3. when there is a returned value of 'suggestions' based on user input, set state of suggestions to returned values(in the case of the mock function, the first 10 items in the array).
4. render those properties onto the input element in the JSX.
NOTE: This would be more specific without the ambiguities of a mock API, given a real API and documentation to build on.
